    "To answer this question we first need to define the concepts of **TF-IDF score** and **cosine similarity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TF-IDF** stands for **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency**. This tecnique is used to quantify the words inside a document by giving a weigth to each word in proportion with its importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this score is given by two main components:\n",
    "- *Term Frequency*: that measures the frequency of a word in a document. It is given by: $\\textrm{tf}(t,d)=\\frac{\\textrm{count of t in d}}{\\textrm{number of words in d}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Document Frequency*: it measures the importance of the document by counting the number of documents is which a certain word is present (at least one time): \n",
    "$\\textrm{df}(t) = \\textrm{occurrence of t in documents}$\n",
    "\n",
    "But we actually need the *Inverse Document Frequency*:\n",
    "it measures the informativeness of the term t in the document. IDF will be small if the occurence of the words is very big and viceversa:\n",
    "    $\\textrm{idf}(t) = \\frac{N}{\\textrm{df}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "There may be some problems with $IDF$, in particular in the cases where the corpus is really large, so in this case it may be convenient to take the log of it.\n",
    "Also, if a word that is not in the pre-determined vocabolary occurs, its df will be equal to $0$, but then we would have a division with 0 at the denominator, which, of course, is going to lead to an error. To solve this issue we are just going to add a 1 to the denominator. So, the final formula is: $\\textrm{idf}(t) = \\textrm{log}(\\frac{N}{\\textrm{df}+1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the TD-IDF score is defined by:        \n",
    "\n",
